 It is like a digital space where where information is stored in structured way which makes it is easy to retrive that information , manage and update that information.

### 1. Stractured Storage:
It is stored in a specific format , often in tables with rows and columns , making it easy to querry and analyze.
### 2. Consistency :
The data stored is consistent, meaning that the same types of data is stored in same way across the database.

### 3.Integrity:
Data integrity ensures that the data is accurate and reliable.

### 4. Scalability: 
Databases can grow in size , handling more data without performance issue.


# What is data-base-managment-system ?
A data base managment system is a software that act as mediator between data bases and user to update , create , delete and manage data while ensuring data is secued and consistent.

# What is relational data base managment system  ?
(RDMS) stands for relational data base managmnet system. It is a type of data base managment system (DBMS) that store data in structred formate, using rows and columns , which are organised into tables. The key feature of an RDBMS is that it uses relationships ( or links ) between tables to manage and query data efficintly.

# Primary key : 
Each table has primary key as unique identifier for each row  in a table.

# Foreign key:
Relation ships are eastablish using foreign key which are field in one table refer to primary key of another table.

# Normalization:
RDBMS software  often involve the normalization process , which organizes data to minimize redundancy and dependency. Example of rdbms software are MySql , PostgreSql , microsoft Sql Server and orcal data base.

# What is Sql ?
Structured query language is a standardized programming language used to manage and manipulate rlational database. It is the primary language used for managing and manipulating relatin data bases.

# Key components of sql :
1.Data query Language (DQL) : Used to query data from the databases.
Example : SELECT \n
2. Data Manipulation language (DML) : Used to insert , update and delete data.
3.  Data defination Language (DDL) :  Used to define or alter the structure of the database , such as creating altering.  dropping tables. \n
4. Data control language (DCL): used to control access to the data , like granting and revoking permissions.\n
5.Transaction control language (TCL) :Used to manage transaction in the database. \n
Commit (Saves all the changes)
Rollback(undoes all chnages made in current transaction)\n
